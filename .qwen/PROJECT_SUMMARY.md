# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive documentation file (QWEN.md) for a ComfyUI workspace containing multiple AI services for image editing, video generation, and talking video synthesis, to serve as instructional context for future interactions.

## Key Knowledge
- The workspace contains 5 main AI service projects: qwen-image-edit-comfyui, fastwan2.2-5b-network-storage, infinite-talk-v1, wan2.2-14b-loras-v1, and fastwan2.2-5b-packed
- Each project follows a consistent structure with Dockerfiles, API wrappers, and ComfyUI integration
- Two deployment strategies exist: Network Storage (lightweight ~2-3GB images with runtime model downloads) and Consolidated (heavy ~15-20GB images with pre-bundled models)
- Services use FastAPI wrappers for ComfyUI workflows with WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Standard ports: 8188 for ComfyUI web interface, 8189 for API wrapper
- Projects optimized for RTX 4090 with environment variables tuned for performance

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the directory structure of /home/son/Workspace/comfyui
- Read README.md files from all 4 main project directories to understand their functionality
- Examined api_wrapper.py to understand the API structure
- Reviewed the structure.md file in the .kiro/steering directory to understand the project organization
- Created a comprehensive QWEN.md file documenting the workspace architecture, build/run instructions, API usage examples, and development conventions

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Analyze the current directory structure and contents
- [DONE] Read key documentation files to understand the project
- [DONE] Examine API wrapper implementations
- [DONE] Generate comprehensive QWEN.md file with project overview
- [DONE] Complete the context summary as requested
